<p class="anime-desc">Various children's books, collectively known as Pokémon Junior, are also based on the anime.</p>
                       
<p class="anime-desc">In July 2021, it was announced that a live action Pokémon series is in early development at Netflix with Joe Henderson attached to write and executive produce.</p>

            <h2 class="bottom-title"  id="bottom">Manga Series</h2>
            
<p class="manga-desc">There are various Pokémon manga series, four of which were released in English by Viz Media, and seven of them released in English by Chuang Yi. The manga series vary from game-based series to being based on the anime and the Trading Card Game. Original stories have also been published. As there are several series created by different authors, most Pokémon manga series differ greatly from each other and other media, such as the anime.[example needed] Pokémon Pocket Monsters and Pokémon Adventures are the two manga in production since the first generation.</p>

<p class="manga-desc">Pokémon Adventures (Japanese: ポケットモンスター SPECIAL, Hepburn: Poketto Monsutā Supesharu, lit. "Pocket Monsters Special", commonly Pokespe (ポケスペ / ポケSP) for short) is a Japanese manga series based on the Pokémon media franchise created by video game designer Satoshi Tajiri and managed by The Pokémon Company. Tajiri once stated that the series is closest to how he imagined the universe of Pokémon to be.</p>

<p class="manga-desc">The series is written by Hidenori Kusaka. Mato was the illustrator for the first nine volumes. When Mato became ill and was unable to continue illustrating the series, Satoshi Yamamoto took over as the illustrator and still continues as the series' artist.</p>

<p class="manga-desc">Pokémon Adventures is translated into English in North America by Viz Media. As of January 2022, 56 volumes have been released, along with five pairs of mini-volumes depicting the "Black & White", "X & Y", "OmegaRuby & AlphaSapphire", "Sun & Moon", and "Sword & Shield" arc. In Southeast Asia, Singapore publisher Chuang Yi was translating Pokémon Adventures into English, and continued to translate new volumes up to volume 41. The company, however, entered voluntary liquidation in early 2014 and translation stopped. Shogakukan Asia now handles the series in Singapore.</p>
